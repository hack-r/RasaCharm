# RasaCharm
Pre-alpha PyCharm plugin for Rasa.

## The Idea
In Rasa, the synchronization of entities, slots, actions, and other Rasa items across files can be challenging. It is prone to errors and involves a lot of redundant typing. To alleviate this, the aim of this plugin is to simplify the process. It will continuously track the major Rasa files (domain.yml, stories.yml, actions.py, nlu.yml, etc.) in real-time and provide assistance in adding corresponding references to other files when new elements are added.
